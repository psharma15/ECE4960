Every folder has a main file which calls ode function and solvers.
Solvers: Contains all the solvers for three Euler methods and RK34 mehtod.
Validation: This folder has all files for validation.
CircuitSim1: This is for linear RC circuit.
CircuitSim2: This is for non-linear transistor circuit, using EKV current model.
